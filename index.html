                    Before the class begun, I am super excited and proud when signing up for GitHub and LinkedIn
                    accounts as a full-stack developer. Despite all the difficulties that I went through in the
                    Bootcamp course at UC Berkerly extension, I have learn how to code and growth to love it more every
                    day.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion in photography actually brought me to become a developer. My dream is to build my own
                    website that is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Something that
                    represent me as an artist.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, I love to add my personal touch to my own product . I have a super cute chihuahua mixed
                    named Happy. She is my source of happiness and a motivation to overcome all of the stress occur to
                    me daily.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Happy really deserved to have her own web page feature her heart-melt cuteness, but I
                    have not be able to find one templates from the archive on Wix that actually acceptable to my
                    liking. Therefore, I am even more determine to pass this class to acquire skills that I need.
