                                Before the class begun, I am super excited and proud when signing up for GitHub and
                                LinkedIn
                                accounts as a full-stack developer. Despite all the difficulties that I went through in
                                the
                                Bootcamp course at UC Berkerly extension, I have learn how to code and growth to love
                                it more every
                                day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                My passion in photography actually brought me to become a developer. My dream is to
                                build my own
                                website that is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Something
                                that
                                represent me as an artist.

                                Moreover, I love to add my personal touch to my own product . I have a super cute
                                chihuahua mixed
                                named Happy. She is my source of happiness and a motivation to overcome all of the
                                stress occur to
                                me daily.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Happy really deserved to have her own web page feature her heart-melt cuteness, but I
                                have not be able to find one templates from the archive on Wix that actually acceptable
                                to my
                                liking. Therefore, I am even more determine to pass this class to acquire skills that I
                                need.
