                                Before the class begun, I am super excited and proud when signing up for GitHub and
                                LinkedIn
                                accounts as a full-stack developer.
                                Despite all the difficulties that I went
                                through in the
                                Bootcamp course at UC Berkerly extension, I have learn how to code and growth to
                                love it more every
                                day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My passion in photography actually brought me to become a developer. My dream is to
                                build my own
                                website that is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive.
                                Something that
                                represent me as an artist.

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">

                            <p>
                                Moreover, I love to add my personal touch to my own product . I have a super cute
                                chihuahua mixed
                                named Happy. She is my source of happiness and a motivation to overcome all of the
                                stress occur to
                                me daily.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Happy really deserved to have her own web page feature her heart-melt cuteness, but
                                I
                                have not be able to find one templates from the archive on Wix that actually
                                acceptable to my
                                liking. Therefore, I am even more determine to pass this class to acquire skills
                                that I need.
